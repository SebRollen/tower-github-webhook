# tower-github-webhook

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This crate does not currently work as intendedâ€”the middleware empties the request body completely rather than passing the body on to the inner service.

I would not recommend using this crate for anything meaningful until I have had time to fix the issue

`tower-github-webhook` is a crate that simplifies validating webhooks received from GitHub.
